Other commands:
 - morph - given two patches, average all parameters between them

Patch generator:

- I think we're overdriving the xmod and setting it to a value that you can't get to via the GUI,
  leading to some really distorted sounds

- maybe allow for a mix of random envelopes and tried-and-true
  envelopes and filter settings based on good patches; we could tak

- better envelope handling: build a bunch of really good envelopes (6-10 or more), and either:
  - replace all the individual A/S/D/R settings groups
  - add the envelopes, which could sometimes override the randomly generated envelopes,
    allowing for some wild envelopes while still providing plenty of good working envelopes

- mod envelope:
  - modulate oscillator transposition really fast to get a little more punch on a pluck
  - modulate oscillator unison detune (start relatively un-detuned, and widen it)

- add settingsGroups for stuff like 
  - formant
  - feedback
  - distortion
  - stutter
  - sequencer

- conditional settings (like only apply a mod envelope transpose if the amp envelope has a
  fast attack; only apply portamento when poly = 1, etc.)

- portamento / legato - really should only kick in when poly = 1

- add settingsGroups for "flavor":
  - mod envelope grows slowly and:
    - brings out some interesting LFO
    - turns up the delay
    - turns up high frequency osc
    - turns up high frequency feedback
    - affects stutter softness
  - very slow LFO modulates things like
    - amplitude of another LFO that modulates filter settings
    - amplitude of another LFO that modulates pitch settings
    - amplitude of another LFO that modulates mix settings (osc1/osc2/sub/noise)
    - amplitude of another LFO that modulates crossmod settings
 - sequencer
    - modulate filters
    - modulate mix
    - modulate pitch
    - bring in on slow mod envelope
    - use slow LFO to affect slide
 - use S/H lfo
